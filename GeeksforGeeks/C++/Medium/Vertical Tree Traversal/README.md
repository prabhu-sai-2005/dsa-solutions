### 📜 Problem Description

Given the  **root**  of a Binary Tree, find the vertical traversal of the tree starting from the leftmost level to the rightmost level.

**Note:** If there are multiple nodes passing through a vertical line, then they should be printed as they appear in level order traversal of the tree.

**Examples:**

```
Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, N, N, N, 8, N, 9, N, 10, 11, N]
                    
Output: [[4], [2], [1, 5, 6, 11], [3, 8, 9], [7], [10]]
Explanation: The below image shows the horizontal distances used to print vertical traversal starting from the leftmost level to the rightmost level.
     

```

```
Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, N, 6]
     
Output: [[4], [2], [1, 5], [3], [6]]
Explanation: From left to right the vertical order will be [[4], [2], [1, 5], [3], [6]]
```
